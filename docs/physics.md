# Physics: friction and the arm controller

Two aspects of the simulated contact physics examined in RoboLab Verified: what was
found and what was changed. Both were raised by reviewers watching episodes ("it's
grabbing right at the edge of the banana — I'm not sure this would work in the real
world").

- [Friction](#friction): a run parameter (`--friction`, P79); the default is unchanged.
- [The arm controller](#the-arm-controller-gravity-off-pd-40080-eef-offset): documented
  and unchanged.

## Friction

### What the assets carry

Friction is baked into the USD files. Every object carries its own `PhysicsMaterial`
(catalogued in [`assets/objects/object_catalog.json`](../assets/objects/object_catalog.json),
fields `static_friction` / `dynamic_friction`), the robot USD carries one for the finger
pads, and every scene defines a `/world/PhysicsMaterial` that nothing binds to. Read back
from the files (2026-08-28, upstream v0.3.1):

| surface | static = dynamic μ | count |
|---|---|---|
| Robotiq 2F-85 finger pads (`left_inner_finger`, `right_inner_finger`) | **2.0** | — |
| objects | 2.0 | 289 of 312 |
| fruit (`fruits_veggies` dataset: lemons, oranges, onion, avocado…) | 5.0 | 9 |
| Objaverse bagels, apple, bell pepper, lunch bag | **10.0** | 7 |
| basic blocks | 0.8 / 1.0 | 4 |
| no material (`gregorys_coffee_cup`, `large_storage_rack`) | PhysX default 0.5 | 2 |

PhysX combines the two materials of a contact pair with the average rule
(`physics:frictionCombineMode` is unset everywhere, and average is the default). So the
coefficient that decides whether a grasp holds is

| contact pair | effective μ |
|---|---|
| pad – typical object | (2.0 + 2.0) / 2 = **2.0** |
| pad – fruit | (2.0 + 5.0) / 2 = 3.5 |
| pad – bagel | (2.0 + 10.0) / 2 = **6.0** |
| object – tabletop (no material → PhysX default 0.5; confirmed by readback) | (2.0 + 0.5) / 2 = 1.25 |

Static equals dynamic everywhere; for real materials dynamic is lower.
Dry rubber on plastic, cardboard or glazed ceramic is roughly 0.5–1.0; on fruit skin
lower. Simulators without pad compliance typically sit at 0.5–1.0 to compensate for
rigid contacts (Isaac Lab's own default material is 0.5). Upstream's asset guide asks
for "2.0–5.0 for reliable grasping" ([objects.md](objects.md)). The values were tuned
for grasp reliability. They are not measured coefficients.

The consequences reviewers saw were edge pinches, one-finger holds and towed objects that a
real pad would let slip (see `TOWED_WITHOUT_GRASP` in [event_tracking.md](event_tracking.md)
and the tow analysis in `docs/verified/changes.md`).

### What Verified does: `--friction` (P79)

Friction is a run parameter. The benchmark default is the authored material; a run
without the flag is bit-identical to upstream. Every eval runner accepts

| `--friction` | effect |
|---|---|
| `upstream` (default) | authored USD materials, untouched |
| `<number>`, e.g. `0.5` | that coefficient (static = dynamic) on every rigid object and on the finger pads; the effective pad–object μ is the same number |
| `realistic` | the bundled per-class table [`robolab/core/physics/friction_realistic.json`](../robolab/core/physics/friction_realistic.json): pads 0.8/0.7, plastics/cardboard 0.4/0.35, ceramics/glass and metal utensils 0.3/0.25, wood blocks 0.5/0.45; effective pad–object μ 0.55–0.65 |
| `path/to/table.json` | a user table in the same format |

A table maps the catalog's `class` field to `{static, dynamic}` (or a single number for
both); `default` covers unlisted classes and objects the catalog does not know, `gripper`
is applied to the robot's pads. Keys starting with `_` are comments. Dynamic must not
exceed static.

**How it is applied.** At env-cfg build time (`GeneratedTaskEnvCfg.__post_init__`)
`robolab.core.physics.friction.install` adds one Isaac Lab
`randomize_rigid_body_material` event term per rigid scene object, plus one for the
robot's `friction_bodies`, in `startup` mode with a degenerate range `(μ, μ)` and a
single bucket, i.e. it sets the PhysX shape materials once, at start-up. Restitution
is carried over from the catalog so only friction changes. No USD is edited; nothing
runs per step.

**Scope.** The
tabletop (`/world/table`, `../fixtures/table_oak.usd`) is a rigid object in the scene
(PhysX-default 0.5/0.5 upstream, no catalog row), so an override reaches it; a table
resolves as class `fixture` (`realistic`: 0.5/0.45). The pedestal fixture under it and any
kinematic/static scene body are `AssetBaseCfg`, which the event term cannot address, and
keep their authored material. The ALOHA/Kinova/dual-Franka pad bodies are declared from
their asset link names but have not yet been read back on a GPU (DROID has).

**Provenance.** Every run records both what was asked for and what PhysX holds:

- `env_cfg.json` → `friction`: mode, the flag text, per-object requested
  `{static, dynamic, restitution, source}` where `source` names the catalog class the
  value was resolved from, the pad material and the pad body names.
- `friction_applied.json` (next to it): the PhysX readback after start-up, a `summary` per
  object and pad followed by the per-shape rows. It is written under `upstream` too, so the baseline's 2.0 is
  a measured value.

`scripts/verify_patches.py` compares the two (predicate P79): PASS when every
target holds the requested coefficient, FAIL on any mismatch, N/A for an `upstream` run
or a recording that predates P79.

**Probe without a policy.** `examples/run_empty.py --task BananaInBowlTask --headless
--friction 0.5` boots one env, steps it with zero actions and leaves the two files under
`output/run_empty_env/BananaInBowlTask*/`.

For GUI mode (Isaac Sim 6), use `--visualizer kit` instead of `--headless`.

**Robot label.** A robot cfg names its pad bodies with the `friction_bodies` label
(assigned after the class, like `ee_recorder_bodies`; see
[robots.md](robots.md#label-assignment-rules)):

```python
DroidCfg.friction_bodies = ["left_inner_finger", "right_inner_finger"]
```

Without the label an override applies to the objects only and a warning is printed;
`verify_patches.py` then reports P79 as FAIL for that run, because half the contact pair
was left at 2.0.

### Why the default did not change

Changing the benchmark's physics changes every published number, and there is no
labelled ground truth for the right μ. The available evidence is the sensitivity
experiment described in FINDINGS §5: the same policy and the same tasks at several
coefficients. RoboLab Verified ships the parameter and publishes the measurement. The
default will change only if the measurement shows that the ranking of policies depends
on it.

**Protocol (rc7 friction sweep).** π0.5 (`pi05_droid_jointpos`), 4 envs per task, the
eight tasks below, at `--friction upstream`, `1.0`, `0.5`, `realistic`; outputs
`output/rc7_<mode>_<Task>`. Reported per condition: success rate, `OBJECT_CARRIED`
count, `GRASP_ATTEMPT_FAILED` count, `TOWED_WITHOUT_GRASP` count, and the fraction of
carries that ever load both pads (`scripts/contact_force_profile.py`, P77).

| task | why |
|---|---|
| BananaInBowl | the reference pick-and-place; π0.5 succeeds often, so a drop is visible |
| FoodPacking2Cans | the spam-heaviest task; cans and boxes, many attempts |
| BlackItemsInBin | wedged smartphone, marker; the stuck-to-finger cases |
| FruitsOnion | fruit at μ 5.0 today; the biggest change under any override |
| GrabAFruit | a pure lift, scored on 50 mm of rise |
| StackWhiteMugs | the labelled tow ("a crazy bug, 100 %") |
| ClutterPumpkin | clutter, bumps, `SCENE_SETTLING` |
| BowlStackingRightOnLeft | rim grasps of nested bowls |

`scripts/friction_sweep_report.py output/rc7_*` renders the per-condition table (success
rate, carries / failed attempts / drops per episode, tows, one-pad carries, and the P79
verdict of every run, so a condition whose materials were not applied is marked and excluded
from comparison). Results are recorded in `docs/verified/changes.md` under P79 as they come in.

### Results (rc7, 2026-08-29)

Pod `robolab-verified6` (L40), π0.5 jointpos, 4 envs per task, one process per task,
all 32 runs complete. Every override run's `friction_applied.json` passes the
P79 predicate; the coefficients below are the values PhysX held.

| task | upstream (μ 2.0) | 1.0 | 0.5 | realistic (≈0.6) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BananaInBowl | 3/4 | 3/4 | 3/4 | 3/4 |
| BlackItemsInBin | 0/4 | 0/4 | 0/4 | 0/4 |
| BowlStackingRightOnLeft | 0/4 | 0/4 | 1/4 | 0/4 |
| ClutterPumpkin | 0/4 | 0/4 | 0/4 | 0/4 |
| FoodPacking2Cans | 0/4 | 0/4 | 0/4 | 0/4 |
| FruitsOnion | 1/4 | 2/4 | 3/4 | 2/4 |
| GrabAFruit | 0/4 | 0/4 | 0/4 | 0/4 |
| StackWhiteMugs | 1/4 | 1/4 | 1/4 | 2/4 |
| **success rate** | **5/32 (16 %)** | 6/32 (19 %) | 8/32 (25 %) | 7/32 (22 %) |
| carries / episode | 2.2 | 1.8 | 1.5 | 1.3 |
| failed grasp attempts / episode | **1.6** | 5.8 | **7.3** | 7.2 |
| drops (closed hand) / episode | 0.4 | 0.6 | 0.8 | 0.9 |
| events / episode | 20.0 | 27.5 | 30.0 | 28.2 |
| tows / physics-artifact episodes | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 |
| objects off the table | 4 | 2 | 2 | 1 |
| one-pad carries | 2/69 (3 %) | 3/59 (5 %) | 2/47 (4 %) | 4/43 (9 %) |

**Observations.**

1. The success rate does not fall when friction drops from 2.0 to 0.5. It rises slightly
   (16 → 25 %), but 5/32 against 8/32 is not distinguishable (Fisher p = 0.54; the
   95 % Beta intervals are 0.07–0.32 and 0.13–0.42). The hypothesis in FINDINGS §5, that
   the published leaderboard is "substantially an artefact of contact tuning", is not
   supported on this slice: π0.5's outcomes on these eight tasks are robust to a 4×
   change in μ.
2. The behaviour metrics depend on friction. Failed grasp attempts go 1.6 → 7.3 per
   episode (×4.5), carries 2.2 → 1.5, closed-hand drops 0.4 → 0.9. At realistic friction
   the policy slips and re-grasps more often before reaching the same outcome:
   FoodPacking2Cans goes from 26 to 131–149 failed attempts across four episodes,
   ClutterPumpkin from 6 to 57. Every event-based metric this fork reports (attempt
   counts, drop counts, carries) is friction-dependent, so comparisons of those metrics
   across runs are valid only at one stated `--friction`.
3. Fruit at μ 5.0 lowers the success rate. FruitsOnion is the only task whose result
   changes (1 → 2 → 3 of 4 as μ drops); its onion and lemons are the objects authored
   at 5.0.
4. The "magnetic object" artifact is independent of friction. The only two
   `TOWED_WITHOUT_GRASP` flags in the sweep fired at μ 0.5 (`BlackItemsInBin` env 2
   `marker` @ 108.7 s, `ClutterPumpkin` env 1 `orange_01` @ 54.3 s), the same
   stuck-to-finger behaviour reviewers labelled at 2.0. It survives a 4× friction cut,
   which rules out the material coefficient; the contact or solver stage remains. These
   are also the first runtime firings of P43.
   The cause is now established: the object tunnels through the 6 mm pad collider and hooks
   behind it when the finger sits at a joint limit; see [verified/towing.md](verified/towing.md)
   (P124) for the mechanism, the prevalence in the recorded corpora and the solid-pad fix.

**Decision.** The default stays `upstream`. The measurement is published with the
benchmark. Comparisons of behaviour metrics must state the friction used;
`friction_applied.json` in every run directory records it. Statistical power is limited:
32 episodes per condition resolves a ~25-point difference in success rate but not a
10-point one.

## The arm controller: gravity off, PD 400/80, EEF offset

`robolab/robots/droid.py` spawns the Franka with `disable_gravity=True`, implicit PD
actuators at stiffness 400 / damping 80 on all seven arm joints, and records the
end-effector at the Robotiq `base_link` with `EEF_OFFSET_POS = (0, 0, 0)`.
This was flagged during the code audit (plan item C2) as a possible source of
unrealistic behaviour. It is unchanged, for the following reasons:

- **It is Isaac Lab's reference configuration.** `FRANKA_PANDA_HIGH_PD_CFG` in
  `isaaclab_assets/robots/franka.py` is exactly `disable_gravity = True`, stiffness 400,
  damping 80, with the note "useful for task-space control using differential IK". The
  plain `FRANKA_PANDA_CFG` (gravity on, 80/4) is the compliant variant meant for
  torque-level control.
- **Gravity-off is the stand-in for gravity compensation.** Isaac Lab's implicit actuators
  are pure PD; they have no gravity-compensation term. A real Franka running the DROID
  stack compensates gravity in its controller, so its joints do not sag toward their
  targets. With gravity on and no compensation the arm would hang below every commanded
  pose by `τ_gravity / stiffness` (several degrees at the shoulder), which a real DROID
  arm does not. Turning gravity on without adding a compensation term would make the
  simulation less like the robot. Adding one is a controller change.
- **The EEF offset is a reporting convention.** `ee_pose` is the pose of the gripper
  base ([frames.md](frames.md)), and every analysis script in this fork
  reads it that way (`GRASP_JAW_BODY = "base_link"`). Moving the frame to the fingertips
  would change every recorded trajectory without changing any behaviour.

What was checked: the config matches the Isaac Lab source line for line (2026-08-28), and
the recorded action/joint traces on the rc-series runs show absolute joint targets
tracked without drift (`docs/verified/changes.md`, "sanity gate": median hand→target
distance 1.3 cm on the corpus).
